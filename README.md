# Intro
Singing Competition is a project in my Database systems course. The project is for the sake of learning how to create a database starting from the user requirement to the database implementation.

# Project organization and notes
The project is divided into two phases. The first one is to design an EER digram to reflect the data requirement. The other phase is for taking the design into practice
by implementing it in a database system. My team decided to use Oracle DB, an object-oriented relation DBMS, as our tool to code the project. A web app is also implemented
for lecturer to test the working of our system. In the back-end, we use Django web framework; while ReactJS is used for our front0-end. However, because some techinical
issues, source code for backend and frontend is already get lost. The team will try to update them as soon as possible
